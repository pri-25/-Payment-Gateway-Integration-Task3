        <p>"Kindness and compassion towards all living things is a mark of a civilized society. Conversely, cruelty,
            whether it is directed against human beings or against animals, is not the exclusive province of any one
            culture or community of people."

            â€• Cesar Chavez.</p>
        <p>Pets give unconditional love to humans and they expect the same in response. A pet not only deserves to be
            fed but also to be treated like humans.Our organisation aims at providing shelter to abandoned animals and
            also provide food,water and medicines for the strays.Join us to care for them and return their love.</p>
